<span>Established in 1950, <a href="http://saha.ac.in">Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics</a> is an autonomous institute for basic research and training in physical and biophysical sciences.
  Named after the Meghnad Saha, the physicist, the institute offers a number of Research, Doctoral, and Post Doctoral Programs in Physics and Nuclear Physics.</span>
<span>The administrative control of the institute with the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India, according to an agreement entered with the institute in 1992.

The institute has a governing council chaired by the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, India (and Secretary, DAE, Govt. of India).
The other members comprise of three scientists nominated by the DAE, two representatives of the DAE, two nominees of Calcutta University,
 one nominee of Govt. of West Bengal and the Director of the Institute.</span>

 <span>I was a summer project intern at Saha Institute of Nuclear Phyics from May'14 to July'14.
   I worked in the Plasma Physics division under the supervision of Prof. A.N.S Iyengar.
   I did a research project with the guidance of Dr. Pankaj Kumar Shaw, A research fellow at the time. </span>

   <span>The main objective of my project was to perform experiments on a chaotic signals generated by Duffing oscillator circuit and obtain output characteristics by varying the amplitude,
     frequency and type of forcing input applied to the Duffing system. I conclude the report by pointing out that, Up to a certain level the addition of noise in the input signal amplifies the output and makes the output coherent,  thus coherence resonance occurs; But if we further increase the amplitude the output becomes stochastic.
     Thus, by addition noise to the system, we saw coherence resonance and stochastic resonance being induced in the system.
